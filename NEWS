Changes in version 2.0.0 (2021-12-01)
  	1. Print Methods
	   a. Created print.ldBounds: almost identical to summary 
              (just leaves off the exit probabilities)
	   b. Created print.ldPower: almost identical to summary
              (just leaves off the exit probs, and puts the
              lower/upper probs up with the boundaries, instead
              of separating)
	   c. Edited summary.ldPower: to give power when drift is
              known (put space before probs table)
        2. Better two-sided bounds and defaults rather than weird
           parameters
	   a. Created 'sides' argument for ldBounds
	   b. Added ability to specify the number of looks, which
              then automatically creates equally spaced analysis
              times
	   c. Sides=2, but with only one alpha, etc., creates
              symmetric bounds, splitting the provided alpha in
              half for each, upper and lower bounds
	   d. Print and summary functions updated to account for
              this
	3. ldPower to use output from ldBounds
	   a. ldPower can now accept an 'ldBounds' object as the first
              argument, in which case, it does not require za,
              zb, t, t2
	   b. Defaults to drift=0 when nothing is specified
	4. Nominal alpha level at each look provided (for
           one-sided or symmetric bounds)
	   a. ldBounds now has additional value: nominal alpha at
              each look.
	   b. Summary.ldBounds displays this
	5. 'asf' changed from asf/alpha to asf
	   a. 'asf' now uses just asf rather than asf alpha (this
              was only a change to 'alphas' function)
	6. Weird integer errors
	   a. ldBounds and alphas now have checks that take into
              account floats
	7. Ability to specify non-alpha spending boundaries
	   a. Created new function 'commonbounds' to calculate
              Pocock or O'Brien-Fleming (non-alpha-spending)
              bounds at equally spaced times.
	   b. These also become 'ldBounds' objects
	   c. Adjusted print and summary functions to accommodate
	8. Calculate adjusted p-values
	   a. Added p-value functionality to ldPower function;
              stepwise and likelihood ratio ordering available.
	   b. Uses a new adj.p function which, ironically, calls
              ldPower.
	   c. Edited printing and summary functions to use this
              as well.
	9. Graphics
	   a. Now uses base graphics, very simple
	   b. Option to show on either z-value or b-value scale
	   c. Ability to add to existing plot
	10. Conditional power
	   a. Added 'condpower', a function to calculate simple
              conditional power
